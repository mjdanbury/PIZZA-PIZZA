        <p>
          For more than five years now, I've had a blast making pizzas at home
          with friends and family. The whole ordeal of topping your own pizza
          and launching it into the oven is so fun that at first I was able to
          look past the fact that my crusts were considerably denser and/or
          flabbier than those I could get at local parlors and slice shops.
        </p>
        <p>
          But truth be told, the crust is really what distinguishes good pizza
          (i.e. all pizza) from great pizza, and in the time since, I've spent a
          good deal of time trying to figure out
          <b>what makes for a great pizza crust?</b>
        </p>
        <h2>To Zeroth Order, Equipment</h2>
        <p>
          As a 20-something moving from apartment to apartment, I was incredibly
          reluctant to invest in a cumbersome 20lb pizza steel and a hilariously
          large loading peel. But I waited to my own detriment: in a home oven,
          it is simply not possible to transfer heat to your pizza quickly
          enough without the thermal mass and conductive heating that a pizza
          stone (preferably steel) provides.
        </p>
        <p>
          After begrudgingly accepting the laws of physics and joining the ranks
          of the pizzaioli by dropping $60 on what was basically two large
          pieces of metal, my crust quality skyrocketed.
        </p>
        <h2>Beyond That, Technique</h2>
        <p>
          With this new equipment, I was also able to tap into the expertise of
          my favorite food YouTuber,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BrianLagerstrom">Brian Lagerstrom</a
          >. Brian's baking content to be some of the best I've found. Not just
          best on YouTube, not just best on the internet, best I've found end
          stop. It just so happens that Brian has a whopping 28 videos devoted
          to pizza, in which he exlpores a number of regional pizza styles from
          across the US and Italy.

          In comparing these recipes, I was able to pick up on some broader
          trends. While he has a number of pizza dough recipes that come
          together in a few hours, many of the recipes he has made to express a
          regional style in it's fullest involve cold fermenting the dough for
          up to several days. According to Brian, this improves both the flavor
          and the crispiness of the resulting crust.
        </p>
        <div style="min-height: 323px">
          <script
            type="text/javascript"
            defer
            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dfoVa/embed.js?v=3"

        </div>
        <p>
          Another thing I picked up on was that lower hydration doughs used more
          fat and vice versa. This persisted across all styles I compared. While
          techniques like fermenting, kneading, shaping, and baking varied
          across these styles, these relative amounts of fat to water seems to
          be a constant of great crust.
